<h3 style="color: yellow;"> Critic Notes </h3>
<p style="color: blue;"> <sup>*</sup>the film's conflicting tones, with Gunn's signature self-aware humor and jokes undermining emotional moments and creating "tonal whiplash". 
    <br>
<sub>*</sub>Critics argue that the script tries to cram too many story elements, characters, and modern-day themes into the first solo film, making it overstuffed and unfocused.  </p>
